Process-Data
========

This tool processes a specific text file as input and returns output as specified below.

The input file represents a list of places and people at different times. There are two distinct formats mixed in the same file:

1. Each line starts with F or D.
2. If F, this is a "format" line and two formats can be provided (1 or 2).
3. If D, this is a "data" line whose format is defined by the closest above format line.
4. If "F1" is specified, you can expect these fields separated with a comma:
 * a. D defining a data line
 * b. Name and surname
 * c. City
 * d. ID formatted as "12345678Z"
5. If "F2" is specified, you can expect these fields separated with space-semicolon-space:
 * a. D defining a data line
 * b. Name and surname
 * c. City
 * d. ID formatted as "12345678-Z"
